# 2024_BaZrS3_Phase_Transitions

Data and plotting scripts for the paper [Octahedral tilt-driven phase transitions in BaZrS3 chalcogenide perovskite](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14289)
File structure:
 - Scripts used to plot the figures with the main text are named using `fig_****.py` or `Fig_xxx*.ipynb`
 - Other jupyter notebooks are used to plot data and figures fot the supplementary information and addtional analaysis.  
 - All data used in the plotting scripts are in `data`, additional README is provided inside.
 - All figures plotted using the scripts provided are saved in `figs`
 - The models trained using the HSE06 and PBEsol functionals are stored in `models`
 - All structures for the orthorhombic, tetragonal and cubic phases we predict for the BaZrS3 perovskite are present in `structures`
